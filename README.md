Prevents item duplication using bundles.

Bundle Unduplicator requires the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

## Installation

1. Download Bundle Unduplicator from [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bundle-unduplicator/files) or [GitHub](https://github.com/haykam821/Bundle-Unduplicator/releases).
2. Place the downloaded file in your `mods` folder.

## Usage

When this mod is installed, attempting to insert an item into a stack of bundles will separate the bundles and place the item in only one. This fixes an issue where the item would them be inserted into every bundle of the stack, allowing the stack to be separated and the inserted item duplicated.
